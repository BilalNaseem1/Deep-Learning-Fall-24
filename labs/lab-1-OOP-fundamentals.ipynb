    "### What are Objects\n",
    "- An object is an instance of a class with its attributes or properties defined. Objects hold actual data and the behaviour of the object is defined by classes.\n",
    "- It also helps in modelling and manipulation of data in a structured manner.\n",
    "- Objects contain data (attributes) and actions (methods)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Definition of a Class\n",
    "- A class is a collection of instance variables and methods (functions which are inside classes).\n",
    "- Both of which together define the nature / characterstics of an object type.\n",
    "- Classes dont hold individual data, they only define how the data should be structured for objects and there is only 1 copy of a class even if there are many objects created from it.\n",
    "- Once a class is made, there can be multiple objects created using that class.\n",
    "#### Alternate definition\n",
    "Classes are the blueprints or templates from which objects are instantiated."

    "### Object Oriented Programming\n",
    "It is the practice of building the code / program around objects, which in turn serve as the building blocks to manage and organize our code. OOP makes the code modular as it makes the code maintainable and understandable.Some languages such as Java force you to be Object Oriented while writing code, where as python is a bit flexible i.e. you can choose to write the code in procedural, functional or in object oriented style. The Deep Learning Framework **PyTorch** requires the code to be written in oop style."
