# Deep Learning by Dr. Tahir Syed - Fall 2024

This GitHub repository contains lecture notes I created last year while taking this course. I will periodically upload refined versions of these notes, which you can access via the links below. Additionally, I will be adding lab tutorials. Each tutorial will include an optional but highly recommended homework task designed to complement the lectures and help you develop the skills needed for the course project.
